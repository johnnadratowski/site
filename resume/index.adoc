## About Me

I thrive in a situation where I can lead a team to face new and difficult challenges.  I love to teach, which I find extremely rewarding.  Conversely, I find learning fascinating, whether it be about software, science, or history.  I am a true believer in open source software.

I strongly believe that software is all about people, and that if you foster good and open communication, you end up creating great software.

## About Me

I relish new challenges and have confidence in the face of those challenges.  Not for sake of hubris, but because I love what I do.  I practically jump out of my seat when I come up with a solution.  I find learning fascinating, whether it be about software, science, or history.  Conversely, I love to teach, which I find extremely rewarding.  I am a true believer in open source software.

I strongly believe that software is all about people, and that if you foster good and open communication, you end up creating great software.

I'm looking for a role where I will be working on new, interesting challenges.  Preferably at a place that is open source friendly and contributes back to the community.
